# Data

One can read about in [data](data) folder.  

# Training

# Inference

Folder [inference](inference) contains two `.ipynb` files with code to extract prediction from T5 and Qwen models. 

# Evaluation

Evaluation requires installation of ERRANT (`python3`) and/or M2Scorer (`python2`). I recommend setting up virtualenvs for both. For further instruction I invite you to read the `README` of the [process_and_evaluate](process_and_evaluate) folder.
